## KPIS / Indicators

**OBV:** On-Balance Volume (OBV) is a technical analysis indicator that measures buying and selling pressure by adding or subtracting volume based on price movement

**MACD:** Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is a technical analysis tool used to identify new trends and signal potential buy or sell opportunities in a market.

**ATR:** Average True Range (ATR) is a technical indicator used in trading to measure market volatility. Unlike other indicators that focus on price movements, ATR considers the range of price movements. This means that it takes into account any gaps or limit moves that occur outside of normal price movements. With ATR, traders can better assess the potential risk and reward of a trade, and adjust their strategies accordingly. So if you want to trade with a deeper understanding of market volatility, using ATR is a great way to start.
